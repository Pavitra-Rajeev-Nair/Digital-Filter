The given MicroVision code implements a real-time digital signal filtering system using:
UART communication for receiving and sending samples
A fixed-point Butterworth low-pass filter
DAC output for analog monitoring

This is used to receive raw signal data via UART, filter it using a digital filter, and then:
Send the filtered result back over UART
Output it to a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) for oscilloscope monitoring
